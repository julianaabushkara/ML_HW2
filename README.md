# ml-assignment-music-analysis

**Goal**: Predict if a song is released as a `single` or as part of an `album` (includes `compilation`).

### ðŸ“¦ Data Source
- Spotify and YouTube metadata, including:  
  - Song, artist, album info  
  - Popularity scores  
  - Musical features (danceability, energy, loudness, etc.)

Original dataset: [Kaggle - Spotify and YouTube](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salvatorerastelli/spotify-and-youtube)

### ðŸ§© Tasks Breakdown

#### **Section A**: Data Exploration & Visualization
- At least 5 visualizations across 3+ plot types.
- Observations and trends reported with plots.

#### **Section B**: Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Created required and custom features (e.g. Album Song Count, Average Artist Views, Song Name Length, etc.)
- Handled missing values, scaling, transformations, and feature selection.

#### **Section C**: Classification
- Predict `Album_type` using 3 ML models (e.g. KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
- Hyperparameter tuning with train/validation/test split (80/10/10).
- Evaluation metrics + comparison of model performance.

#### **Bonus**: Feature Importance
- Used correlation, drop analysis, and mutual info to evaluate feature impact.

#### **Section D**: Clustering
- Applied 2 clustering algorithms (e.g. K-Means, Agglomerative).
- Explained cluster meaning, visualized results, and evaluated quality.

#### **Section E (Bonus)**: Artist-Level Analysis
- Aggregated features at artist level (e.g. avg views, #singles, avg fitness score).
- Explored artist behavior and applied a custom ML model on this data.
